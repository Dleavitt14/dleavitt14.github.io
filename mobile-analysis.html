            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I very rarely use my computer for surfing. I almost always use my phone. The first thing that I searched for was the times that Soda Vine closed. I just searched "Soda Vine" in google and it automatically brought up the address, phone number, and store hours. It was very easy to find and see what I wanted to see.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I was always able to find what I was looking for. One other example I had was when I looked up a local news station from my home town. I wanted to see what the weather was like there. They had a navagation bar that was easy to use that led me right to where I wanted to be. </p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>For my accounting class we use a site called socrative.com. This site we typically use our laptops for, but I decided to use my phone that time. We were given a quiz to take and I found it very easy to use. I actually think I will probably do it that way from now on.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>To be honest,  did not have any frustrations. I very rarely use my computer to look things up. I find it easier and more efficient to just pull out my phone to do it.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>One thing that I looked up was whether or not Larry H. Miller still owned the Jazz in Utah. The article I found was very simple and to the point. Using mobile probably got rid of a lot of the adds and other fluff the website may have had. I liked this much better.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>What did you learn? Where there any surprises?</p>
            <p>Completing this assignment confirmed my thoughts I have had that my phone is the best way to search things on the web. Companies and businesses have made it a priority to make their website accessable through mobile. I was a little bit surprised about how easy it was to search for something within a website on my phone. Other than that I was not very suprised. It did however make me think that I need to learn how to make a website work well and look good on a mobile device.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
