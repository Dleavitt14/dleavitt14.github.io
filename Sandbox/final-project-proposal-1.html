                <h2>Subject</h2>
                <p>For my final project I will be creating a website that will show some family reunions we have been on. It will show pictures and list some of the fun things that we did!</p>
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>The purpose of my website will be to remind my family and I about some of our familiy reunions! There will be a list of things we did so we can be reminded of things we have done that we liked so we can plan for future reunions. This website will be added to as we go on more reunions.</p>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience of my website will be specifically my cousins, aunts and uncles. I want them to be able to come to my site and be reminded of the good times they had on our reunions. I also hopw to traget those of my family that are planning the future family reunions. That way they can see the things we did that was fun and we enjoyed.</p>
